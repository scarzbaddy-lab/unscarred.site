                        <h3>What you actually need</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Self-soothing skills</strong> for the first 10 minutes of a trigger</li>
                            <li><strong>Reality checks</strong> before you accuse or pursue</li>
                            <li><strong>Identity outside the relationship</strong> so their schedule is not your stability</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> you can heal this, but it starts with owning the part where your anxiety is writing the script.</p>
