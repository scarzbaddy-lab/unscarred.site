        <p class="sub">I turn scars into mirrors.

I study the patterns behind your pain and turn them into a mirror so you can finally see what is really happening and what you can do next.

I did not learn this from a textbook first. I learned it in real time inside a family full of undiagnosed neurodivergence, survival mode, and emotional chaos. Real psychosis. Real learning differences. Real trauma that nobody had language for.

On paper I was the smart kid. Teachers loved me. I stayed quiet, soaked up information, and never caused trouble at school. At home I was the witness. I watched adults melt down, shut down, numb out, and explode. I saw how shame and survival patterns can swallow a whole house.

I have been the scapegoat who gets blamed for saying the truth. I have been the golden child who makes the family look good while falling apart in private. I have been the black sheep who feels everything and gets punished for noticing too much. Later I walked into narcissistic and psychological abuse because my body was used to danger and confusion.

Pattern tracking was not a hobby for me. It was how I stayed alive emotionally. I learned to notice what was said, what was never said, what always repeated, and what never healed. That is the core of Unscarred. I turn that way of seeing into maps that help you understand yourself instead of hating yourself.</p>

          <h2>What you will find here</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Quizzes</b> that map your patterns with eerie accuracy so you can see your mix of survival strategies instead of a vague label</li>
            <li><b>Breakdowns</b> that explain why you think, feel, and react the way you do in love, conflict, and survival mode</li>
            <li><b>Sessions</b> where we walk through your story and build a clear pattern map for your nervous system and your relationships</li>
            <li><b>Tools</b> like scripts, questions, and small nervous system practices you can use in real life, not just in theory</li>

            <li>I am not a therapist or a doctor. I am a survivor, a pattern reader, and an educator.</li>
            <li>A lifetime inside a family with untreated trauma, psychosis, and learning differences, watching patterns repeat when nobody has support.</li>
            <li>Personal experience with narcissistic and psychological abuse, trauma bonds, and the slow process of getting my mind back.</li>
            <li>Years of studying attachment, nervous system science, and personality patterns, then translating it into plain language.</li>
            <li>Quizzes and posts strangers call the most accurate thing they have ever read about themselves.</li>

          <h2>How I work and what this is not</h2>
          <p>
            I am trauma informed and I take this work seriously. Many people who find Unscarred are in active survival, in confusing relationships, or fresh out of abusive situations.
          </p>
          <div class="divider"></div>
          <p>
            I am not a therapist and I do not give medical, psychiatric, or legal advice. This site and my sessions do not replace professional care.
            If you are in crisis or in danger, get emergency and local support first.
          </p>
          <div class="divider"></div>
          <p>
            What I do offer is pattern support. I help you understand your attachment style, your nervous system responses, and your relationship dynamics.
            It is the curriculum nobody taught you, and the part most therapists do not have time to break down in depth.
          </p>
          <p class="note"><b>Truth:</b> your patterns are not your fault. Learning them and changing what you can is your power.</p>

            <li>You are stuck in a bond that feels like love and addiction at the same time and want a clear map, not another quote</li>
            <li>You have traits that look like BPD, autism, ADHD, or even narcissism and want the full story without shame or sugarcoating</li>
            <li>You are tired of vague advice and want language, insight, and tools that match what your body does under stress</li>

            <li>You only want someone to tell you the other person is the entire problem and never reflect anything back to you</li>
            <li>You need formal diagnosis, medication management, or crisis level care</li>
            <li>You are not ready to be honest about your own survival habits and how you protect yourself, even when it hurts other people</li>
            <li>You want a trick to make someone love you, chase you, or come back without doing any inner work</li>
