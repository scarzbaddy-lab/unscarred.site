  <article class="article-content">
    <p>If you have been abused for years, you do not always look like a victim.</p>
    
    <p>You look like the strong one, the understanding one, the one who always sees both sides, the one who keeps the family together, the one who can handle it.</p>
    
    <p>From the outside, people might even say you are lucky.</p>
    
    <p>They see the photos. They see the kids dressed nice. They see the wedding ring. They see you smiling.</p>
    
    <p>They do not see the part where your stomach drops every time you hear their car in the driveway. They do not see the conversations you rehearse in your head and never say out loud. They do not see you crying quietly in the bathroom holding the sink so you do not fall apart.</p>
    
    <p><strong>You do.</strong></p>
    
    <div class="highlight-box">
      <p>You know the nights you have stayed up feeling crazy.</p>
      <p>You know how many times you have tried to explain and ended up apologizing.</p>
      <p>You know how many chances you have given.</p>
      <p>You know how much of yourself you have lost trying to be "reasonable."</p>
    </div>
    
    <p>If you have been abused for years, you become good at holding two realities.</p>
    
    <p>The one you show everyone else. The one you live in alone.</p>
    
    <p>You know every detail of their trauma, their childhood, their stress, their triggers. You could give a whole presentation on why they are the way they are.</p>
    
    <p>Ask yourself a question.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Can you give the same depth and compassion to your own story?</strong></p>
    
    <p>Or do you go blank when you ask what you need?</p>
    
    <p>This is not because you are weak. It is because you were trained to do four things over and over: Understand them. Excuse them. Fix them. Blame yourself.</p>
    
    <p>You learned that your value is in how much you can carry.</p>
    
    <p>So when they scream, you try to be calmer. When they lie, you try to communicate better. When they cheat, you try to be more attractive or less emotional. When they withdraw, you try to chase less, to not be "clingy."</p>
    
    <p>You run experiments on yourself instead of on the relationship.</p>
    
    <p>You keep thinking "If I can just get my reactions under control, we will be okay." "If I can just heal my attachment issues, he will stop treating me like this." "If I can just be more patient, she will stop raging."</p>
    
    <p>Years pass.</p>
    
    <div class="highlight-box">
      <p><strong>Here is the part nobody tells you.</strong></p>
      <p>Someone who loves you will benefit from your growth.</p>
      <p>Someone who uses you will hide behind it.</p>
      <p>If every new level of self awareness you reach becomes a new excuse for them to do less, care less, and own less, you are not in a relationship.</p>
      <p>You are in a rehabilitation center that only has one patient. And it is not them.</p>
    </div>
    
    <p>Abuse is not always a punch. Sometimes it is the slow erosion of your sense of reality.</p>
    
    <p>The constant message that you are too sensitive, you are too dramatic, you remember wrong, you took it out of context, you should not feel that way.</p>
    
    <p>So read this as if you were listening to your best friend, not yourself.</p>
    
    <p>If your friend told you "My partner calls me names, then says it is a joke. They flirt with other people and say I am insecure. They scream or stonewall for days when I bring up a concern. They threaten to leave every time I have a boundary. They use my diagnosis, my trauma, my emotions as proof I am the problem."</p>
    
    <p>Would you say "Girl, maybe if you communicated better it would stop?"</p>
    
    <p>Or would you say "You are in something that is killing you?"</p>
    
    <p><strong>You already know what you would say.</strong></p>
    
    <p>You are not confused because the situation is unclear. You are confused because the answer hurts.</p>
    
    <p>Leaving means losing the fantasy, losing the image, losing the good moments, losing the version of them you were in love with, losing the life you thought you were building.</p>
    
    <p>Staying means losing yourself in slow motion.</p>
    
    <p>You are not stupid for staying this long. You were loyal. You were hopeful. You were doing the best you could with the knowledge you had.</p>
    
    <p>There was a whole education you never got. No one taught you what healthy felt like, what respect looks like, how a regulated apology sounds.</p>
    
    <div class="highlight-box">
      <p>You are allowed to learn that now.</p>
      <p>You are allowed to decide that the next ten years of your life will not look like the last ten.</p>
      <p>You are allowed to leave a story even if everyone else thinks it looks fine on the outside.</p>
      <p><strong>Here is the truth that keeps trying to rise up in you:</strong></p>
      <p>You are not the problem child of the universe. You are a woman who has been abused for a very long time and got good at calling it "love."</p>
      <p>You are allowed to stop. Not when you have become a perfect healed person. Now.</p>
