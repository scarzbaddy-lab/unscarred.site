  <article class="article-content">
    <p>Some of us are not just sensitive. We are wired like mirrors.</p>
    
    <p>You walk into a room and feel everything at once. You pick up tension in people who are smiling. You sense chaos in people who look put together. You know when someone is lying to themselves even if their lie is technically not hurting anyone yet.</p>
    
    <p><strong>You do not just read people. You translate them.</strong></p>
    
    <p>That is a gift. It is also exhausting.</p>
    
    <p>You become the one everyone comes to when their life falls apart. You are the one who can take their mess and put it into words that make sense. You say things they did not even know they were feeling until the tears start.</p>
    
    <p>Claircognizance. Hyper empathy. Emotional pattern recognition. Those are just big words for "I know things I was never told" and "I feel things that do not belong to me."</p>
    
    <div class="highlight-box">
      <p>It looks magical from the outside. It feels heavy from the inside.</p>
      <p>You see the survival masks people wear. You see the scared child behind the rage. You see the frozen terror under the perfectionism. You see the manipulative tactics and the broken longing under them.</p>
      <p><strong>You are the mirror that reflects the truth, not just the image they wish were real.</strong></p>
    </div>
    
    <p>Why does this matter?</p>
    
    <p>Because if you do not understand your own gift, you will think you are cursed.</p>
    
    <p>You will think you are "too dramatic" for reacting to vibes everyone else claims are fine. You will think you are needy because you cannot tolerate fake connection. You will think you are judgmental for noticing patterns that honestly are not safe.</p>
    
    <p>You will also attract people who want the benefits of your insight without ever giving anything back.</p>
    
    <p>They want free therapy. Free translation. Free spiritual insight. Free emotional labor.</p>
    
    <p>What they do not want is to look at themselves in the mirror you are holding.</p>
    
    <p>So they flip it.</p>
    
    <p>One day you are wise, insightful, a life changer. The next day, when your reflection shows them something they do not want to see, you are "toxic," "negative," "obsessed with trauma," "over analyzing everything."</p>
    
    <p>The gift did not change. Their tolerance for the truth did.</p>
    
    <div class="highlight-box">
      <p>If this is you, here is what you need to know.</p>
      <p>You are not here to be everybody's mirror on demand.</p>
      <p>You are not required to keep translating for people who weaponize your honesty against you.</p>
      <p><strong>You are allowed to aim your gift at your own healing, your own work, your own creations.</strong></p>
    </div>
    
    <p>You will still feel deeply. You will still see what others miss. That will never fully turn off.</p>
    
    <p>But you get to choose where you stand and who you reflect back to. You get to stop letting people treat your nervous system like a free diagnostic tool while they ignore every result.</p>
    
    <p><strong>You are not too sensitive. You are tuned in. You are not overthinking. You are decoding. You are not broken. You are built like a mirror in a world that prefers dark rooms.</strong></p>
    
    <p>Use that on purpose now.</p>
